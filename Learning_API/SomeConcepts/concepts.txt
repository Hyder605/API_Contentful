Sequential Data Feteching: 
    one data can be fetched at one time
    time consuming
    one order ate one time
    can't make a 2nd order until the first one is completed/resolved

Parallel Data Feteching:
    multiple data can be fetched at one time
    Musch Faster
    e.g: ordering multiple dishes at resturant and getting them all the dishes at one time

************>Server Side Rendering(SSR)----->1.Static 2.Dynamic

Static Rendering:
    -"NO matter how many times you refreshed the page the content will remain same in Static Rendering.<br/>
     -By Default NextJS rendering is Static"
     -Static rendering refers to the process of pre-rendering a web page's HTML and CSS content during the build process, instead of rendering it dynamically at runtime.
     -"One of the main advantages of static rendering is that it allows for better search engine optimization (SEO) 
        because search engines can easily crawl and index the content of the website. 
            Additionally, static rendering can reduce the load on the server, as it does not 
                have to generate the HTML and CSS on every request."
    
Server_Dynamic Rendering:
    -"Everytime user visit/refresh the page ,api will be called and rendered on every call.
    -Api will fetch on server.
    ```cache: 'no-store' is a setting that instructs the browser not to cache the response 
       to the request. This means that every time the same request is made, the browser will 
       always fetch a fresh copy of the response from the server, instead of using a cached copy.```


Client-side rendering:
    - Write "use client"  at the top of the page for client side rendering.
    -"Api will call on everytime the request is sent but this time on client side.
    -"install "swr" library also "npm i swr"
    -"Client-side rendering-involves rendering the HTML and CSS content of a web page in the user's browser using JavaScript.
     This means that the server only sends the necessary data to the browser, 
     which then renders the content."


CDN vs Edge Computing:
    Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) are like a network of warehouses that store and deliver digital content, such as web pages, images, and videos, to users from        servers that are closer to them. This makes the content load faster and more efficiently, like getting a package from a nearby local store instead of waiting for it    to be shipped from a distant warehouse.

  On the other hand, Edge Computing is like having a mini-computer right at the place where data is generated, like having a smart device that can process data and run    applications locally, without needing to send all the data to a central computer in a faraway location. This allows for faster processing and quicker response         times, similar to making decisions on the spot rather than waiting for instructions from a remote location.
    
    CDNs focus on delivering content faster by storing copies of content(static pages) in different locations, while Edge Computing focuses on processing data closer to where it's generated for quicker responses.
